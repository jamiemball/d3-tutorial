D3 Tutorial

This is a semi-interactive D3 tutorial which should help you get well on the way to mastering D3 in a short period of time.

Having spent a long time trawling through tutorials and books trying to get to grips with D3, I realised that there was no easy way to get started with D3, '3 circles' was the simplest it got.

I've gone even simpler, so even someone who's only ever used jQuery a little bit should be able to get along quickly with D3 to build graphical visualisations.

To use this tutorial effectively, chuck it on a local web server, and look at the source and result of the index.html.

(It needs a local webserver for the AJAX request to work in the 'loading external data' example).

I hope you find this useful, enjoy!
